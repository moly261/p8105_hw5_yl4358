  - The obeservation in experimental group is increasing overtime while
    the observation in control group is stable. The obeservation in
    experimental group is relative higher than that in control group.

## Conduct a simulation to explore power in a simple linear regression

``` r
sim_results =
  tibble(
  beta1_set = c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
) %>% 
  mutate(
    output_list = map(.x = beta1_set, ~rerun(10000, sim_regression(beta1 = .x))),
    output_df = map(output_list, bind_rows)

  group_by(beta1_set) %>%

    reject_proportion = sum(rejection)/ length(p_value)

  geom_line() +

    title = "Association between effect size and power",

     )
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_yl4358_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="90%" />

  - The effect size has a positive effect on power. With the growth of
    effect size beta1, the power increases.
